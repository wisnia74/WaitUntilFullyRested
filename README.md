# WaitUntilFullyRested

Simple, QoL Bannerlord mod.

## About the mod
I was getting slightly frustrated anytime I wanted the "wait" sequence in settlement to stop automatically, once my character regenerated back to 100% stamina and the wait just kept on running. So I wrote a mod that does exactly that.

***Need to smith a lot and can't be bothered with "guessing" at what point your character regenerated back to 100% stamina? This mod is for you!***

The mod is fully localised, however I achieved that using Google Translate so the results might not be good in some cases. Since it's really small and simple, it has no dependencies. There's probably a ton of stamina mods out there, but I really wanted to just have a QoL feature and not something that would alter the gameplay in any way.

The mod can be found on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/4515).

## How it works
It adds a simple button "Wait until you are fully rested" to towns and castles (not to villages because waiting in a village does not regenerate stamina anyway).

**The button will be visible only if your main hero is below 100% stamina.**

It will trigger a regular wait menu with one twist - once you reach 100% stamina, the wait will stop and you will be taken back to main settlement menu.

This way, you wait exactly as long as it takes to regenarate stamina back to 100%. Isn't that beautiful?

## Installation
